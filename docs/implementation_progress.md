# Implementation Progress

## Current Status

The repository now contains a deterministic Stage-1 BVG liability baseline. The
current implementation covers BVG formulas, cohort dataclasses, portfolio state
and projections, retirement transitions, BVG cashflow generation, multi-year
liability projection, deterministic liability valuation snapshots, annual
liquidity analytics, and an end-to-end demo scenario with CSV export.

The full test suite currently passes with **420 passed**.

| Sprint 2D | Retirement transitions | `src/pk_alm/bvg/retirement_transition.py`, `tests/test_bvg_retirement_transition.py`, updated `src/pk_alm/bvg/engine.py` | Convert active cohorts reaching retirement age into retired cohorts and emit KA capital withdrawal cashflows. | Boundary ages, capital withdrawal fractions, conversion rate, engine integration. |
| Sprint 2E | Liability valuation snapshots | `src/pk_alm/bvg/valuation.py`, `tests/test_bvg_valuation.py` | Value portfolio states as deterministic Stage-1 liability snapshots. | Active-only, retired-only, terminal age, pensionierungsverlust, missing values, float tolerance. |
| Sprint 2F | Annual cashflow analytics | `src/pk_alm/analytics/cashflows.py`, `tests/test_analytics_cashflows.py` | Aggregate cashflows by year and compute structural/net liquidity inflection years. | Grouping, cumulative sums, structural vs net cashflow, currency validation, dtype robustness. |
| Sprint 2G | Stage-1 baseline scenario | `src/pk_alm/scenarios/stage1_baseline.py`, `examples/stage1_baseline.py`, `tests/test_stage1_baseline_scenario.py` | End-to-end demonstrator: engine → valuation → analytics → CSV export. | Default portfolio, export, import safety, custom horizon, parameter pass-through. |

## Current Architecture

The codebase is organised into six layers, each tested independently:

1. **BVG domain layer** — formulas, cohorts, portfolio state, projections,
   retirement transitions.
2. **Cashflow interface layer** — shared 7-column schema and BVG cashflow
   generation that emits schema-valid records.
3. **Engine layer** — deterministic multi-year liability projection that
   composes the lower layers and emits one combined cashflow DataFrame.
4. **Valuation layer** — Stage-1 liability snapshots with the simplified
   `total_stage1_liability` proxy.
5. **Analytics layer** — annual cashflow aggregation and structural/net
   liquidity inflection year detection.
6. **Scenario layer** — a reproducible Stage-1 demo runner with CSV export.

## Current End-to-End Demo

The end-to-end Stage-1 demo can be run with:

```bash
python examples/stage1_baseline.py
```

Expected output includes:

- the number of portfolio states,
- the number of cashflow rows,
- the number of annual cashflow rows,
- the structural liquidity inflection year,
- the net liquidity inflection year,
- the paths to the CSV outputs.

Generated CSV files (relative to the working directory):

- `outputs/stage1_baseline/cashflows.csv`
- `outputs/stage1_baseline/valuation_snapshots.csv`
- `outputs/stage1_baseline/annual_cashflows.csv`

## Current Test Status

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

Current expected result: **420 passed**.

The tests are part of the verification strategy for the bachelor thesis. They
serve as executable documentation: every financial formula has at least one
manually checkable example, every dataclass has boundary and invalid-input
tests, every validator has explicit failure-mode tests, and the scenario layer
has integration tests that pin down the pipeline.

## Known Limitations

The current implementation is intentionally narrow:

- The default demo portfolio is **not** calibrated to a real pension fund. It
  is a small, manually inspectable test/demo portfolio.
- No mortality tables.
- No new entrants.
- No wage growth.
- No inflation or pension indexation.
- No survivor benefits or disability benefits.
- No stochastic interest-rate scenarios in this Stage-1 baseline.
- No ACTUS asset integration.
- No funding ratio logic.
- `total_stage1_liability` is **not** a full actuarial technical liability. It
  is a deterministic Stage-1 proxy and intentionally excludes technical
  provisions / technical reserves (longevity, risk, fluctuation, additional
  reserves for pension losses).
- Asset-side modelling is not yet implemented.

## Next Planned Step

Sprint 3A should implement a deterministic asset baseline and a funding ratio
trajectory. The purpose is to combine asset values with `total_stage1_liability`
to produce an interpretable funding ratio over time. Funding ratio logic should
be introduced only after a minimal asset baseline exists, so that the funding
ratio is well-defined and reproducible from explicit inputs.
