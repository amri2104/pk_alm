Clean rebuild of the pension fund ALM simulation tool for the bachelor thesis
**Enhanced Portfolio Analytics for Pension Funds using ACTUS and Python**.

The current scope is **Stage 1 / Goal 1**: a deterministic economic ALM
baseline focused on cashflow projection, liquidity analysis, and a
transparent liability proxy.

## Current Status

- Deterministic Stage-1 BVG liability baseline implemented end-to-end.
- An end-to-end scenario is available as both a library function and a
  manual-run script.
- Current tests: **414 passed**.

## Quick Run

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

Run the Stage-1 baseline demo:

```bash
python examples/stage1_baseline.py
```

## Generated Outputs

Running the demo writes three CSV files to
`outputs/stage1_baseline/` (relative to the working directory):

- `outputs/stage1_baseline/cashflows.csv` — schema-valid BVG cashflows.
- `outputs/stage1_baseline/valuation_snapshots.csv` — Stage-1 liability
  snapshots per projection year.
- `outputs/stage1_baseline/annual_cashflows.csv` — annual cashflow
  analytics including the liquidity inflection year.

## Documentation

- [docs/implementation_progress.md](docs/implementation_progress.md) —
  current sprint-by-sprint status, architecture summary, and known limitations.
- [docs/stage1_pipeline.md](docs/stage1_pipeline.md) — technical description
  of the end-to-end Stage-1 pipeline.
- [docs/stage1_spec.md](docs/stage1_spec.md) — Stage-1 specification.
- [docs/domain_notes.md](docs/domain_notes.md) — domain background.
- [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) — architectural decision records.

## Scope

The current implementation is the **liability-side deterministic Stage-1
baseline**:

- No assets and no funding ratio yet.
- No ACTUS integration yet.
- No stochastic interest-rate scenarios yet.
- No mortality, new entrants, wage growth, inflation, survivor benefits, or
  disability benefits.
- The `total_stage1_liability` reported by the valuation layer is a
  deterministic Stage-1 proxy and intentionally excludes technical reserves.

These extensions are deferred to later sprints; see
`docs/implementation_progress.md` for the next planned step.
